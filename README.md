## Problem Statement
For my data engineering course project, I chose to utilize the [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018). The dataset is a summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights. 

This dataset is not readily analyzable, and my goal was to make data that was ready for analysis.
