## Problem Statement
For my data engineering course project, I wanted to combine two data sets:

 1) [NZ Crash Data from the Crash Analysis System (CAS)](https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/crash-analysis-system-cas-data5). The dataset contains information from New Zealand's crashes from 1-January-2000, and is updated monthly. It is created by the by Waka Kotahi - the NZ Transport Agency. 

 2) [Christchurch's Traffic Count Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dJXE9XieHTazo1JUo67h8M0rPMYl7gZe). This is a collection of excel spreadsheets created [by the Christchurch City Council](https://ccc.govt.nz/transport/improving-our-transport-and-roads/traffic-count-data), which contains traffic count data for several key intersections in Christchurch. 

While NZ crash data has [already been combined and and mapped with traffic data by roadsafetyrisk.co.nz](https://roadsafetyrisk.co.nz/maps/heat-maps#Canterbury), I am not sure if this was generated using Christchurch's traffic data, or by some other data source. There is no open data on this website.

Further downstream of this data engineering project, I would like to create a similar map to the one made by Road Safety Risk, and highlight dangerous sections of Christchurch, by the count of (fatal) crashes per unit traffic. It will be a fun project to compare my results to the one [made above](https://roadsafetyrisk.co.nz/maps/heat-maps#Canterbury).
